        <h2>About v5DoR</h2>
        <div>
            The V.5. Department of Robotics is a multinational organization consisting of the world's top minds on Physics, Social Engineering, Astrosociology and Political Science. It's purpose is to have as deep an understanding as we can of the whereabouts, motives, and capabilities of the known local cluster of Magic Robots. We use this knowledge to advise global leadership on issues from defense to immigration to developing technology.

        <h2>Privacy Concerns</h2>
        <div>
            While it is clear that the Robots are able to scan at levels we do not understand, we have yet to successfully download or intercept any legible data from them other than that which they offer. They consistently make available to us a stream of information over a copper line at 14,400kbps encrypted with a dynamic key which they grant at the beginning of each transmission.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <div>
            The V.5. Department of Robotics was created in 1984 after Incedent Zero involving the first known Magic Robots.

        <div>
            There were those who believed the entire incident was fabricated due to a lack of footage (a result of the EMP). Certain conspiracy theorists were in powerful positions within the global sphere of influence. A multinational congress was formed to vote on the manifestation of a new organization for the harboring and protection of what were officially deemed Magical Beings and Objects, defined in Article 12 (C.15).
        </div>
        <div>
            After almost a decade of purely benevolent presence, benefitting all in their actions and technological contributions, in 1992 the Sovereign Machine Act (SMA) was passed which granted the beings legal free roam and global citizenship. The current state of relatively common Magic Robot sightings as well as their involvement in international conflict resolution is largely due to the SMA.
